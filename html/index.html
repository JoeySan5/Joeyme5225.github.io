            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
                I strive to give back to my community through my determination of creating a more sustainable environment. I am dedicated to using my problem-solving skills to solve any problem that arises on my journey to help others.
                I am not afraid to leave my comfort zone and dive into the unknown ensuring I seek help from others who have the same goals. With these new relationships I make, I am comfortable making a close-knit family so communication strives in our teamwork efforts.
                I want to be at the top when it comes to the Fin Tech industry.
