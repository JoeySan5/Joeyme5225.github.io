                <h3>A Dynamic leader and Collaborative Team Player</h3>
                <p>
                    This is due to my strong communication and collaboration skills. Effective communication and collaboration are crucial when working with a fast paced team. 
                    I am adept at articulating ideas, actively listening to others, and providing constructive feedback. By fostering a clear and collaborative atmosphere, 
                    I ensure all team members are aligned and constantly improving. This way no member is left behind and collaboration is seamless. Furthermore, my diverse background, particularly my interactions with diverse families and communities in South America, provide me with new perspectives. is essential to offering new ideas because I would be able to introduce my team with new perspectives. 
                    This would help contribute to creative problem-solving and  help resolve team issues from a fresh and inclusive standpoint.

                <h3>My passions</h3>
                <p>
                    I currently serve as the Secretary of Lehigh’s Entrepreneurship Club (New Venture’s Club).
                     In this role, I actively foster entrepreneurship throughout campus by organizing workshops and speaker events.
                      We work as a very flexible and fluid team. Therefore, I manage various responsibilities that range from marketing to finances. 
                      We are a very motivated team finding new ways to educate our members. All while we create a safe, kind, and knowledgeable community
                       within our club. My enthusiasm for this club and entrepreneurship began so I could create my own business to help better my community.
                        I come from a town with many underrepresented families and have seen first hand the educational disparities and violence faced by these families. 
                        I am determined to leverage my skills in computer science and my ability to connect with diverse individuals to create an innovative software solution 
                        that empowers underrepresented communities by providing them with quality education. I am also committed to combating the spread of misinformation through
                         the web and social media, understanding the detrimental consequences it can have on vulnerable communities. 
                    Through these endeavors, I aim to contribute meaningfully to society and create a better future for those who need it.

                <h3>What I want to improve upon</h3>
                <p>
                    Being surrounded by motivated individuals with similar interests would create an exciting environment to form strong relationships.
                     Collaborating with these hardworking and determined startup teams would allow me to gain insightful new perspectives. 
                     For example, engaging in meaningful conversations would cultivate a stronger entrepreneurial mindset. Startups thrive on 
                     innovation and creative problem solving, and being part of such an environment would challenge me to think outside the box and
                      embrace a growth-oriented mindset. These conversations would also encourage self-reflection, enabling me to learn from past experiences 
                      and plan for future endeavors. An area that I am eager to improve upon is time management. Startups require careful planning and allocation 
                      of resources, especially time. Working with the startup teams would expose me to effective time management strategies and learn from their
                       experiences. I would be excited to absorb their advice, applying them to enhance my own time management skills.
On a professional level, SVII would be beneficial in helping me discover what I am truly passionate about within the realms of computer science. I am eager to explore and learn about emerging technologies and exciting projects the startup companies have that could potentially better our society. I would love to learn about new software that I could use to make a positive impact on society. I am particularly enthusiastic about eliminating the spread of misinformation online and creating software that could better the education of underrepresented communities. Working with a startup team would provide me with a platform to channel my passion into meaningful projects, aligning with my long-term career goals.
