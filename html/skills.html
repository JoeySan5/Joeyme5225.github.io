                <h3>A Dynamic Leader and Collaborative Team Player</h3>
                <p>
                    I am a dynamic leader and collaborative team player, known for my strong communication and collaboration skills. 
                    I believe that effective communication and collaboration are crucial in working with fast-paced teams.
                     I excel in articulating ideas, actively listening to others, and providing constructive feedback. By fostering
                      a clear and collaborative atmosphere, I ensure that all team members are aligned and constantly improving. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     
                    My diverse background, shaped by my interactions with my families and communities in South America, offers me fresh perspectives.
                     With my mother born in Peru and my father from Colombia, I have had the opportunity to visit both countries extensively and gain 
                     a deep understanding of their distinct cultures. Interacting with university students from these regions has been particularly 
                     enlightening, as their experiences differ significantly from what I have encountered at Lehigh University. Drawing on these 
                     diverse perspectives allows me to contribute to creative problem-solving and approach team issues from an inclusive standpoint.

                <h3>My Passions</h3>
                <p>
                    I currently serve as the Secretary of Lehigh’s Entrepreneurship Club (New Venture’s Club). 
                    In this role, I actively foster entrepreneurship throughout the campus by organizing workshops and speaker events.
                     I manage various responsibilities ranging from marketing to finances, as we work as a flexible and fluid team. 
                     Creating a safe, kind, and knowledgeable community within our club is essential. 
                </p>
                <p>
                     My enthusiasm for entrepreneurship 
                     and creating positive change in my community stems from witnessing the educational disparities and violence faced by
                      underrepresented families in my hometown. I am determined to leverage my skills in computer science and my ability 
                      to connect with diverse individuals to develop innovative software solutions that empower underrepresented communities
                       with quality education. Additionally, I am committed to combating the spread of misinformation through the web and 
                       social media, understanding its detrimental consequences for vulnerable communities. Through these endeavors, I aim
                        to contribute meaningfully to society and create a better future for those in need.

                <h3>What I want to Improve Upon</h3>
                <p>
                    As I continue to grow, I strive to improve various aspects of myself. Surrounding myself with motivated
                     individuals who share similar interests will create an exciting environment for forming strong relationships.
                      Collaborating with hardworking and determined startup teams will provide me with insightful perspectives and 
                      cultivate a stronger entrepreneurial mindset. Startups thrive on innovation and creative problem-solving, and
                       being part of such an environment will challenge me to think outside the box and embrace a growth-oriented mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                        I am particularly eager to enhance my time management skills, as startups require careful planning and resource allocation.
                         Learning from the experiences of startup teams and adopting effective time management strategies will be invaluable to me.
                        I am passionate about exploring emerging technologies and engaging in projects that can positively impact society. I am particularly enthusiastic about eliminating the spread of misinformation online and creating software solutions that improve the education of underrepresented communities. Working with a startup team would provide me with a platform to channel my passion into meaningful projects that align with my long-term career goals.
