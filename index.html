                    I strive to give back to my community through my determination of creating a more sustainable environment. I am dedicated to using my problem-solving skills to solve any problem that arises on my journey to help others.
                    I am not afraid to leave my comfort zone and dive into the unknown ensuring I seek help from others who have the same goals. With these new relationships I make, I am comfortable making a close-knit family so communication strives in our teamwork efforts.
                    I want to be at the top when it comes to the Fin Tech industry.

        To the right, I showcase a server/client program with socket programming that I built using C/C++ langauges. The client can send images to a server which stores it in a hashmap as local memory. 
        The stored information (in the hashmap) can be retrieved back to the client.
