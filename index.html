                    I am a curious, ambitious student, and a natural leader. I love hearing about people's unique backgrounds and brainstorming ideas and solutions to each community's distinctive problems.

                    I am on a mission to promote education and peace for underrepresented communities. As well as stop the spread of misinformation in our society to prevent conflict.

                    I am uniquely positioned to do this work because of my diverse experience with countries I have traveled to and lived in such as my parent's native countries (Peru and Colombia). I am strongly determined to learn more about computer science and focus on machine learning to identify how it can help me on my mission.

                To the right, I showcase a server/client program with socket programming that I built using C/C++ languages. The client can send images to a server which stores it in a hashmap as local memory. 
                The stored information (in the hashmap) can be retrieved back to the client.
